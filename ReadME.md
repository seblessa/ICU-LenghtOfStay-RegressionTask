# AlphaZero
Assignment for Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Class, 3º Year,2º Semester, Bachelor in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Project 2 – Develop an Alpha Zero Ataxx Player

# Summary

In this project our goal is to implement an AlphaZero player for the game Ataxx and for the game Go.

The AlphaZero algorithm is a reinforcement learning algorithm
that uses a neural network to approximate the value function and the policy function.
The neural network is trained using self-play and Monte Carlo Tree Search.
